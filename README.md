# Best-Movies-TV-Shows-of-Netflix

•	In this project, I utilized SQL queries to analyse a dataset containing information on 5608 movies and TV shows available on Netflix. By leveraging my SQL skills, I identified the best content based on IMDB ratings and prepared a detailed presentation that provided recommendations considering factors such as year, genre, and language. 
•	These insights empowered stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding content curation and selection, thereby enhancing the user experience and driving customer satisfaction
